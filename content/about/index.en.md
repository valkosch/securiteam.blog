I'm Valentin Kurcz, a 19 years old , hungarian, carbon-based computer engineer student at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), and I'm glad to meet you. I love repairing and tinkering old stuff, creating new things, hiking, baking pizza, also I love westend movies, and sliced bread. Oh and my toothbrush is purple. You can find my projects and works on this website, but also my takes and thoughts on many topics, to which you can always leave a comment or two, if you want to express your opinion. In this section you can read about my education, my skills and my motivation.

# Education 

**2023 - ~ BME VIK**
> Currently I'm doing my studies at The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of BME, where I can deepen my knowledge of IT. Here I'm acquainted with every aspect of computer science, even more, I get introduced to computer architecture, which gives me the power to fully understand the hardware I'm programming and using. I empathize this because, it's becoming more of a trend, even among programmers, to see the computer, our primary tool, as a black box. This leads to software which is bloated, because its excessive memory or CPU cycle use. One reason to do this, would be to speed up the development process, and increase the production rate, but do we really value quantity over quality when it comes to programming? A todays progammer like this creates tomorrows legacy code, which is obviously unsustainable. A good master is one who understands his tool, a better one who can change his tool as he wishes. The gist of this, is that I'm not only learning to be a programmer, but also to be professional in Computer Science and Engineering. To program as a computer engineer, is like to bake as a chemist. No elitism intended, just my honest opinion. In IT I'm mostly interested in IT Security and networking, but also as you may have guessed, I like to program in low level languages. I'm also a performance enthusiast. Date of graduation, will be 2026.

> Also worths to mention that I'm a member of Dormitory Computer Society (DCS), which maintains the dormitory network and provides services for up to 1000 students in our dormitory. During my time here, I practiced to apply the theories I learned, with the latest technologies. Inside the DCS, I mostly contribute to the SecuriTeam, where we do pentesting, CTFs and many more.

**My achievements here right now**

* Academic distinction and excellence, scholarschip
* Many projects which you can find at the [~/projects](/projects) site

**2019 - 2023 Leövey Klára Gymnasium**
> I still reminisce with pleasure about my years here, because besides all the fun and good memories I made here, it had prominent positive influence on my personality, and on my ambitions. I studied in the IT course, but after all, I majored in Mathematics. However my interest towards IT began to gain its ground at this time. Many thanks for the hard work of my teachers, because even in the adversity of the hungarian education system, they helped me in my personal development. My achievements are just as theirs as mine.

**My achievements here**

* OPL gunnergook law firm scholarschip
* Leövey prize

# Skills

* experienced in C/C++, Java development, also entry level Go and Python knowledge
* web development with React, Next.js and Hugo (this website was made with Hugo)
* intermediate understandig of concepts in IT Security, SOC Security Analyst, penetration testing, also I solve CTFs in my free time
* DevOps experience with Git

# Motivation

Why am I doing this blog?

My main goal with this site is to document myself, and my work, and to ensure that if somebody, like an employer, wants to see what are my experiences, they will have a platform to do so. In the mean time, I also like to give words to my thoughts, and to start dialog between people, and that's why I write little posts and articles, mostly in IT topics. Also I belive the ["Dead Internet theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) day by day starting to become a reality, where most of the content on the web is either bot or AI generated. That's why I find it important to encourage more and more people to create genuine and valuable content, and then maybe we can bring back the gold years of the internet where there were no ads, no data collecting tech giant conglomerates, and where everyone could enjoy freely the flow of information. As I said before, you can comment under any of my posts, if you ever feel like my take on something is wrong in your opinion, or you need some help with something related, remember no question is too stupid to ask. I intend to help the sharing of knowledge with this. Also starting arguments is no bad, there are problems, and questions where an outsider opinion or perspective is needed to solve it, but please do this in an appropriate and respectful way. I dare say that some of my posts could actually help someone. Lastly, as you may see it, my website is available in 3 languages, english, spanish, and hungarian, where the translation is all done by me.
